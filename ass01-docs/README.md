##2 Project Setup

1. Clone the repository by typing `$ git clone https://github.com/sschauss/ptt.git` into the Terminal or use your favorite GUI Client (e.g. [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [giggle](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/giggle), ...)

##3 Usage

###3.1 Server

Just run the Run Configuration you've set up in step 2.3 to start the server.

Options:

- clientId: The client ID generated by [registering](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps) a SoundCloud application.
- jerseyClientConfiguration.timeout: The time the jersey client waits for a request to finish.
- everything else: Take a look at the Dropwizard [documentation](http://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/manual/configuration.html).

The is written in config.yml [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html). It is also possible to pass a JSON configuration file.

###3.2 Client

Navigate to the ass01-client folder, from there type `$ grunt serve` into the Terminal.

Now you can access the client on <http://localhost:9000>. Grunt intercepts all requests to `/api` and pass them to <http://localhost:8080>. 

A watch task is running in the background, every time you edit a file in ass01-client/app the grunt server compiles CoffeeScript and SASS files if necessary and the webapp will reload.

###3.3 Binaries

Navigate to ass01-bin and run `$ sh run.sh` from the CLI. Then open your Browser on <http://localhost:8080>.
